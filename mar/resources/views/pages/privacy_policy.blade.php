                                    to your question or request; our email communications team would need access to your
                                    contact information to ensure this information is sent correctly and any unsubscribe
                                    requests are properly managed; and our security staff would need to review information
                                    to investigate attempted denial of service attacks, fraudulent account activity, or
                                    other attempts to compromise the Services.

                                    marketing services, communicating with you, managing our customer database, the
                                    provision of professional services, and providing and managing the Services (including
                                    hosting data centers, securing our Services, and payment processing).

                                    We limit the number of service providers who are permitted to process your Content for
                                    the purpose of assisting us in delivering the Services. We refer to these service
                                    providers as "subprocessors".
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Where you have purchased a service from an authorized reseller or partner, we may
                                    provide information about you to (and may receive information about you from) the
                                    reseller or partner as necessary to support your use of the service you purchased.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    When sharing your information with any of the above service providers, resellers and
                                    partners, we ensure they agree to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and
                                    any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and only use your
                                    information to carry out the Services and your requests.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We may also participate in and run marketing events (e.g. conferences, webinars, and
                                    provide resources) with sponsors and other organizations. Where the sponsors or other
                                    organizations wish to collect your information for their marketing purposes, while we
                                    may facilitate this (e.g. information may be collected on the same registration form),
                                    they will be doing so independently under their own policies. We will advise you and
                                    provide you an opportunity for you to share your information with the sponsors or other
                                    organizations for such purposes, either upon registration or during the event.

                                    Where you are using our Services and have chosen to connect your Social Networks to the
                                    Services, or if you authorize a Third-Party Service to access your account, you are
                                    agreeing to provide information about you to the Social Networks and the Third-Party
                                    Services under their respective terms and privacy policies. For example, if you choose
                                    to connect your YouTube account to the Services, this connection uses YouTube’s API
                                    services, and the Google Privacy Policy (located here) will apply to you.

                                    We may need to disclose information about you where we believe that it is reasonably
                                    necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or if we are otherwise legally required to
                                    do so, such as in response to a court order or legal process, or to establish, protect,
                                    or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands. For
                                    governmental data access requests concerning you or your organization, we would first
                                    attempt to redirect the request to you and/or we would first attempt to notify you
                                    unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. For further information, refer to our

                                    In addition, we may disclose information about you if we believe it is necessary to

                                    involving potential threats to our rights or property (or to the rights or property of

                                    regarding situations that involve the security of our Services, abuse of the Services
                                    infrastructure, or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, or denial of
                                    service attacks).

                                    We also use professional advisors, including lawyers and accountants, and may be

                                    <br /><br />
                                    Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws,
                                    information about you may only be transferred from your region to other regions if
                                    certain requirements are met. For instance, under the GDPR, information about you may be
                                    transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA if adequate data
                                    protections are in place.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Our Services are managed by Marketingsolu.com’s headquarters in Germany. As the European
                                    Commission considers Germany to be a country which provides adequate data protection,
                                    information about you may be transferred from the EEA to Germany. For the Marketingsolu
                                    services, we also manage our services from our European entity. Amongst the
                                    Marketingsolu.com corporate entities, we have incorporated appropriate data transfer
                                    mechanisms permitted under European data protection laws.

                                    process your Content are referred to as “sub processors”.

                                    In general for the Marketingsolu.com Services, we do not permanently store Content from
                                    Social Networks. Rather, when you login to the Services, we retrieve data from Social
                                    Networks in real time so that it is displayed in the platform for viewing during your
                                    session. We store other Content that you produce (such as draft Content for publication
                                    on Social Networks) so that you can easily access this material on the Services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Messages in Inbox are stored for 6 weeks to enable you to take any action required, such
                                    as replying to messages. Marketingsolu services allow you to delete information related
                                    to a contact. Marketingsolu.com Analytics products such as Analytics and Insights will

                                    to allow our customers to conduct trending and analysis.

                                    Aggregated data is used by Marketingsolu.com for analysis, product improvement, and
                                    troubleshooting purposes. In some cases, Content may continue to exist on the Social
                                    Networks even after you or we delete it from our Services, and you will need to contact
                                    the relevant Social Network directly if you want it to remove this Content.

                                    for record keeping purposes, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
                                    enforce the terms for the Services. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain
                                    information about you, or otherwise upon your request, we will dispose of it in a secure
                                    manner or anonymize the information.
