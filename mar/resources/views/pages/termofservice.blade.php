                                    Self-Serve Services offered by Marketingsolu (“Marketingsolu”, “we” or “us”), you are
                                    confirming that you have read, understand and accept this Agreement. This Agreement can
                                    be updated from time to time as set out in Section 37 below. You are responsible for
                                    regularly reviewing the most current version of this Agreement, though we will notify
                                    you of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact this Agreement.
                                    Continued use of the Self-Serve Services after any such changes have been made will
                                    constitute your consent to such changes. When we change this Agreement, we will update
                                    the “Last Modified” date above.

                                    This Agreement applies to the “Self-Serve Services”, which are services that you access
                                    or purchase through our website or mobile applications (this does not include
                                    Marketingsolu’s Enterprise and Business plans), as further defined below.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    By using our Self-Serve Services, you confirm that:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    A. You will only use our Self-Serve Services for business and professional reasons;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    B. You are at least 18 years old or otherwise able to enter into a legally binding
                                    agreement;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    C. You accept and will comply with this Agreement;

                                    D. If you are using our Self-Serve Services as a representative of an organization, you
                                    have the power to enter into legally binding agreements for the organization; and

                                    <br /><br />
                                    1. We use capitalization for terms that have a special meaning in this Agreement. While
                                    some terms are defined elsewhere, this section sets out the definitions of some key
                                    terms.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “Content” is a generic term that means all information and data (such as text, images,
                                    photos, videos, audio and documents) in any format that is uploaded to, downloaded from
                                    or appears on our Self-Serve Services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “Customer Content” is Content that you or your Authorized Users provide to us, or upload
                                    to our Self-Serve Services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “Mentions'' are the Content that a third party (in other words, someone other than you,
                                    your Authorized Users or Marketingsolu) creates and that we obtain on your behalf and at
                                    your instruction from Social Networks or other Third-Party Services that you connect to
                                    our Self-Serve Services. For example, posts created by your followers that appear on
                                    your Facebook page would be considered Mentions.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “Self-Serve Services” means our websites, such as Marketingsolu.com (and all its current
                                    and future subdomains), and mobile applications, and any services that you access or
                                    purchase through our websites or mobile applications, but do not include (a)
                                    Marketingsolu’s Enterprise and Business plans, which are governed by different terms; or
                                    (b) Third-Party Services (see below for how we define those) that you access or use in
                                    connection with our services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “Third-Party Services' ' are services that are not provided by Marketingsolu but that
                                    you may access or use in connection with our Self-Serve Services. They include the
                                    “Social Networks'', which are the social networking sites supported by our Self-Serve
                                    Services (such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram), as well as the extensions
                                    and applications available in the Marketingsolu App Directory
                                    (http://apps.Marketingsolu.com).
                                    <br /><br />
                                    “you”, “your”, “Customer”, and similar terms mean the person or legal entity accessing
                                    or using the Self-Serve Services. For the avoidance of doubt, if you are accessing and
                                    using the Self-Serve Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other
                                    legal entity, “you”, “your” or “Customer” means the company or other legal entity that
                                    you are using the Self-Serve Services on behalf of.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Marketingsolu’s Self-Serve Services
                                    <br /><br />
                                    2. Subject to the rest of this Agreement, we will allow you and your Authorized Users to
                                    access and use our Self-Serve Services in the way set out in the plan you subscribed to.
                                    You may not use or access the Self-Serve Services in any other way, such as using
                                    robots, spiders, crawlers and scraping technologies.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    3. Our Self-Serve Services evolve constantly. We may change our Self-Serve Services,
                                    such as by changing, adding or removing features at any time, for any reason. We may or
                                    may not provide notice of those changes to you. We will not be liable to you or any
                                    third party for the modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of any of
                                    our Self-Serve Services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4. Our Self-Serve Services interact with Social Networks and depend on the availability
                                    of those Social Networks and the features and functionality they make available to us,
                                    which we do not control and may change without notice. If at any time a Social Network
                                    stops making some or all of its features or functionality available to us, or available
                                    to us on reasonable terms as determined by Marketingsolu in its sole discretion (each an
                                    “API Change”), we may stop providing access to those features or functionality and we
                                    will not be liable to you or any third party for any such change.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Acceptable Use Rules
                                    <br /><br />
                                    5. You and any Authorized Users using your account must comply with the Acceptable Use
                                    Rules and all laws. If we reasonably believe that you have breached the Acceptable Use
                                    Rules or any applicable law, we may, at any time and without notice, remove any of your
                                    Content and suspend, restrict or terminate your account or your access to the Self-Serve
                                    Services.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Customer Content
                                    <br /><br />
                                    6. You are solely responsible for Customer Content. We may, but do not have to, review,
                                    filter, block or remove Content, including Customer Content.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Submitted Content
                                    <br /><br />
                                    7. If you use the Self-Serve Services for contests or otherwise ask people to submit
                                    Content through the Self-Serve Services (“Submitted Content”), you acknowledge and agree
                                    that:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    (A) the Self-Serve Services do not help you comply with any laws, rules, or regulations
                                    that may apply to your collection or use of Submitted Content, which is solely your
                                    responsibility; and
                                    <br /><br />
                                    (B) we will not be liable to you or any third party for the Submitted Content, and we
                                    make no warranty that any Submitted Content obtained or displayed through the Self-Serve
                                    Services is accurate or complete.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Account Information
                                    <br /><br />
                                    8. You are responsible for the completeness, security, confidentiality and accuracy of
                                    the account information you provide to us. You will promptly notify us of any
                                    unauthorized access to or use of your log-in credentials or account.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Content and Third-Party Services
                                    <br /><br />
                                    9. We are not responsible for Content provided by others, including Mentions and Content
                                    from Third-Party Services (such as Content from Social Networks and Content in apps from
                                    the App Directory). You and anyone else who accesses our Self-Serve Services may access
                                    Content that might be unlawful, offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise
                                    inappropriate. We will not be liable to you or any third party for Content provided by
                                    others.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    10. If you access or purchase a Third-Party Service through our Self-Serve Services, you
                                    do so at your own risk. Your relationship with the Third-Party Service provider is an
                                    agreement between you and them. You specifically understand that we are not responsible
                                    for Third-Party Services and will not be liable to you or any third party for any losses
                                    or damages resulting from your use of Third-Party Services.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    any reason at any time. We may also immediately suspend or terminate your access to our
                                    Self-Serve Services for any reason, at any time, without notifying you in advance. If we
                                    terminate this Agreement because you violated the Acceptable Use Rules or any other part
                                    of this Agreement, you will not receive a refund. If we terminate your access to the

                                    Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
                                    <br /><br />
                                    25. We offer our Self-Serve Services ``as is'' and are not making any warranties,
                                    conditions, representations or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied,
                                    statutory or otherwise, including all express or implied warranties of design,
                                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quality and non-infringement,
                                    that our Self-Serve Services will meet your requirements or that our Self-Serve Services
                                    will always be available, accessible, uninterrupted, timely, secure, accurate, complete
                                    or error-free. Use our Self-Serve Services at your own risk. You hereby release us and
                                    our affiliates and the directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors and service
                                    providers of Marketingsolu and our affiliates (the “Marketingsolu Parties'') from any
                                    claims, known or unknown, you have against them.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    26. We will not be liable for indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or
                                    exemplary damages, or for loss of profits, goodwill or data or other intangible losses,
                                    that result from the use of, or inability to use, our Self-Serve Services or any other
                                    aspect of this Agreement. Under no circumstances will we be liable for any Third-Party
                                    Services, Social Networks or activities of third parties, any connection to or
                                    transmission from the Internet, or for any damage, loss or injury resulting from
                                    hacking, tampering, theft or other unauthorized access to or use of our Self-Serve
                                    Services or your account or the information contained in your account, including
                                    Customer Content.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    27. Our aggregate liability to you for all losses or damages arising out of this
                                    Agreement or your use of our Self-Serve Services, even if we have been advised of the
                                    possibility of such losses, will not exceed the greater of the fees we received from you
                                    for our Self-Serve Services that are subject to the claim during the three-month period
                                    immediately preceding the date on which the damages arose and USD$100. The limitations
                                    of liability in this section also apply to the Marketingsolu Parties and to claims
                                    brought based on any cause of action, including breach of contract, tort (including
                                    negligence), statute or other legal or equitable theory. If there is a law that limits
                                    how the limitation of liability in this section applies to you, our liability will be
                                    limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    28. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from us or elsewhere
                                    will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in this Agreement.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    29. Our prices are set based on limitations of liability and the disclaimers of
                                    warranties in this section. You acknowledge that they will survive and apply even if
                                    found to have failed their essential purpose.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    30. If you are dissatisfied with our Self-Serve Services or believe that you’ve been
                                    harmed by your use of our Self-Serve Services or this Agreement, you may terminate your
                                    use of our Self-Serve Services (as set out above). That termination is your sole and
                                    exclusive remedy (and our sole and exclusive liability) under this Agreement.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Claims and Disputes
                                    <br /><br />
                                    31. The laws of the Province of British Columbia and Canadian law applicable in British
                                    Columbia will govern any dispute, cause of action or claim arising out of this Agreement
                                    or your use of our Self-Serve Services, including against any Marketingsolu Party
                                    (“Dispute”), without giving effect to conflict-of-law principles.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    32. You will indemnify and hold harmless the Marketingsolu Parties from and against all
                                    losses, damages, penalties, liability and costs, including reasonable legal fees, of any
                                    kind or nature related to any claim against a Marketingsolu Party related to: (a)
                                    Customer Content or Submitted Content; (b) your breach of this Agreement or any laws; or
                                    (c) your use of our Self-Serve Services or any Third-Party Services (including your
                                    breach of terms for any Third-Party Services).
                                    <br /><br />
                                    33. If you breach this Agreement or violate our rights or another person’s rights, we
                                    may ask a court to stop you; if we bring a claim against you, you will reimburse us for
                                    our reasonable legal fees for that claim.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    34. If you have any kind of Dispute with us, the exclusive means of resolving it will be
                                    by confidential, binding arbitration before a single arbitrator chosen by you and
                                    Marketingsolu. You will give notice of your Dispute to us in writing. If we do not
                                    decide together on an arbitrator within 15 days after we receive that notice, we both
                                    agree to ask the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (BCICAC)
                                    to appoint one for us. The arbitration will take place in Vancouver, British Columbia,
                                    under the Arbitration Act (British Columbia), and will follow the Domestic Commercial
                                    Arbitration Rules of the BCICAC. The arbitrator will have the right to decide how the
                                    costs should be divided between us. The arbitrator will have the right to accept
                                    whatever kind of evidence they think is appropriate and will have the right to make
                                    whatever award they consider fair and equitable, based on legal and equitable
                                    principles, including giving an order such as an injunction (to stop one of us from
                                    doing something) or an order that you or we pay damages to the other. The arbitrator’s
                                    award can be entered into the registry of the British Columbia Supreme Court in
                                    Vancouver, British Columbia, and enforced in the same way as a court order if the court
                                    in the enforcing jurisdiction allows.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    35. Any Dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
                                    not in a class, consolidated or representative action. Marketingsolu and you each waive
                                    any right to a trial by jury.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Miscellaneous
                                    <br /><br />
                                    36. Export Compliance. You will not use or access our Self-Serve Services if you are
                                    located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of our Self-Serve Services is

                                    transmission of data exported from the country in which you (or your Authorized Users)

                                    37. Amendment. We may change any part of this Agreement (including any terms or
                                    documents incorporated by reference in this Agreement) at any time by posting the
                                    revised terms on the Marketingsolu website, and your use of the Self-Serve Services
                                    after the effective date of the updated Agreement or other terms constitutes your
                                    agreement to the updated Agreement or other terms, as applicable. It is important for
                                    you to review this Agreement before using our Self-Serve Services and from time to time.
                                    The updated Agreement will be effective as of the time of posting, or on such a later
                                    date as may be specified in the updated Agreement, and will apply to your use of the
                                    Self-Serve Services from that point forward.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    38. Assignment. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement to anyone else. We
                                    may assign our rights to any other individual or entity.

                                    39. Severability. If a court finds part of this Agreement to be invalid, the rest will
                                    continue to apply with the minimum changes required to remove the invalid part.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    40. Force Majeure. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any failure to
                                    perform our obligations under this Agreement if that failure results from any cause
                                    beyond our control, such as the elements; fire; flood; severe weather; earthquake;
                                    vandalism; accidents; sabotage; power failure; denial of service attacks or similar
                                    attacks or other acts of hackers; Internet or network failures or interruptions; acts of
                                    God and the public enemy; acts of war; acts of terrorism; riots; civil or public
                                    disturbances; strikes, lockouts or labor disruptions; any laws, orders, rules,
                                    regulations, acts or restraints of any government or governmental body or authority,
                                    civil or military, including the orders and judgments of courts; or if another person
                                    (including a Social Network) changes their services or terms or no longer offers their
                                    services to you or Marketingsolu on terms we believe are reasonable.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    41. Remedies. If we fail to enforce this Agreement, we are not waiving our right to do
                                    so. Any remedies we have under this Agreement are not exclusive of any other remedies we
                                    may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    42. Notices to You. Marketingsolu may give notice to you by placing a banner notice on
                                    the Marketingsolu platform or Marketingsolu’s website. We may also contact you or your
                                    Authorized Users through your Marketingsolu account or contact information you provide,
                                    such as email or telephone or through your account on one or more Social Networks. If
                                    you fail to maintain accurate account information, such as contact information, you may
                                    not receive critical information about our Self-Serve Services or this Agreement.

                                    44. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the other documents referred to as
                                    applicable to the Self-Serve Services in this Agreement, is the entire agreement between
                                    you and Marketingsolu for your use of our Self-Serve Services. Any prior understandings,
                                    statements or and agreements (oral or written) do not apply, including additional terms
                                    that you may present (such as terms in a unilateral notice from you to us or printed on
                                    a purchase order or any other document generated by you). This Agreement is binding on
                                    the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
                                    <br /><br />
